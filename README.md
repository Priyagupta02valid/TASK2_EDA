# TASK2_EDA
This project presents a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python. The objective is to uncover insights into passenger demographics, survival patterns, and feature relationships using statistical summaries and visualizations.


# Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

 

## What I Learned

- **Data Understanding:**  
  Gained insight into the structure of the Titanic dataset, including data types, missing values, and the distribution of key variables like Age, Fare, and Passenger Class.

- **Data Cleaning Importance:**  
  Noticed missing data in important columns such as `Age`, `Cabin`, and `Embarked`, which highlighted the need for careful data preprocessing before any modeling.

- **Univariate Analysis:**  
  Explored individual features to understand their distributions. For example, the age distribution showed many passengers clustered between young children and middle-aged adults, while the fare distribution was right-skewed.

- **Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis:**  
  Examined relationships between features, such as survival rates across genders and passenger classes. Visualizations revealed that females and first-class passengers had significantly higher survival chances.

- **Correlation Insights:**  
  Used correlation heatmaps to identify relationships among numeric features, understanding which variables might be predictive of survival.

- **Visualization Skills:**  
  Enhanced the ability to create clear and insightful plots (histograms, boxplots, count plots, pairplots, heatmaps) using Seaborn and Matplotlib, and interactive plots with Plotly.

- **Storytelling with Data:**  
  Learned how to draw meaningful insights and summarize key findings effectively, which is essential for communicating analysis results.

## Project Structure

- `titanic_eda.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook containing the full EDA process with code and visualizations.
- `Titanic-Dataset.csv` — Raw Titanic dataset used for analysis (if included).

## Future Work

- Handle missing values using imputation or removal strategies.
- Engineer new features to improve predictive power.
- Build machine learning models to predict survival outcomes.
- Deploy the model or create interactive dashboards for better user experience.
